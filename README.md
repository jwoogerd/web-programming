#### Web Programming (Comp 20) - Spring 2014
___

This repository contains projects completed as part of Comp 20 (Web Programming)
class at Tufts University, which I audited during the Spring 2014 semester.
My favorite project is the transit project in which we used the Google Maps 
API and Boston MBTA data to render an accurate train line map and schedule.
I'm glad I sat in on the class - I've picked up some JavaScript (which I didn't
know before) and have become better at parsing online API documentation.
