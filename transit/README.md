####Assignment 3 - Transit rodeo
___

Correctly implemented (so far):

* Render the map with my current location
* Display an info window with my location and the closest station
* Geolocation
* Show appropriate train line stations with custom markers and polyline

Not yet implemented:

* Display schedule of station when clicked

Other to do:

* Documentation
* Dismiss window when another station is clicked
* Gracefully handle 500 error

So far I've spent about 7 hours on this project.
