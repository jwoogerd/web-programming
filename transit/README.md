####Assignment 3 - Transit rodeo
___

Correctly implemented (so far):

* Render the map with my current location (currently hardcoded in for 
debugging) and info window
* Geolocation (but needs testing)
* Show appropriate train line stations with custom markers and polyline

Not yet implemented:

* Display closest station
* Display schedule of station when clicked

Other to do:

* CSS/HTML validation
* Correct polylines: Alewife and Davis are out of order and supsect some blue
  line stations as well
* Documentation
* Gracefully handle 500 error

So far I've spent about 5 hours on this project.
