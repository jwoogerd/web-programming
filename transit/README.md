####Assignment 3 - Transit rodeo
___

To my knoweledge, everything is implemented correctly, including:

* Rendering the map centered on this current location
* Displaying an info window with my current location, the closest station, and
  distance
* Showing the appropriate train line stations with custom markers and polyline
* Displaying the predicted schedule of a station when the marker is clicked

Future to do:

* Gracefully handle 500 error.

I've spent about 9 hours on this project.
